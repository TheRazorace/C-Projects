# OpenMP Utilization Projects

Four projects about the utilization of OpenMP library in parallel programming. The library is used to accelerate the runtime of the classic K-Means algorithm, the traveling salesperson problem and the error-backpropagation computation in neural networks. All algorithms were written in C language.
